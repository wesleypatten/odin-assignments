        <h1>Boring Blog</h1>
        <h2><i>Day One</i></h2>
        <p>Today was one of the most boring days of my life. I was waiting to get on a train
            and the train <strong>was cancelled</strong>. The annoucer at the train station
            then said that <i>"all train services will be stopped for the day".</i> I had
            no books and I had left my phone at home so I had <strong>nothing to do for the 
            rest of the day!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I will certainly be thinking twice before I take the train again!</p>
        <h2>Day Two</h2>
        <p>Now I have decided to write some lists in order to alleviate the boredom
            of the past few days.
        </p>
